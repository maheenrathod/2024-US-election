# OBJECTIVE

Primary resources: Real Clear Polling, Tiktok Developers API, Google Trends

Primary tools: Python, Excel, PowerBI

## RCP: Real Clear Polling

RCP, a website that offers comprehensive aggregation of polling data gathered information on the favouribilty of both candidates. Between July 7 - July 21, prior to Biden’s withdrawal, the data collected through 10 pollsters revealed a 3.1 lead for Trump againt Biden.

In the following week, however, that figure would decrease to 1.9 with Trump still leading againt Harris. While the news was still relatively new, the 1.2 point downturn in Trump’s favouriblity proves to be a positive change for the Democratic party.
